#We'll develop a model inspired by recent advancements in deep learning and attention mechanisms called the Transformer architecture.
#The Transformer model, introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., has shown remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks. We'll adapt the Transformer architecture for our NFT valuation problem. This model will learn to attend to different features of the NFT metadata and sales data to predict the valuation.
#Here's the code implementing the Transformer model for NFT valuation:


import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, Model

# Define the Transformer model for NFT valuation
class NFTTransformer(Model):
    def __init__(self, num_heads, d_model, num_layers, num_features):
        super(NFTTransformer, self).__init__()
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.d_model = d_model
        self.num_layers = num_layers

        self.embedding = layers.Dense(d_model, activation='relu')
        self.positional_encoding = self.positional_encoding(num_features, self.d_model)

        self.encoder_layers = [self.transformer_encoder_layer(d_model, num_heads) for _ in range(num_layers)]
        self.dropout = layers.Dropout(0.1)
        self.final_layer = layers.Dense(1)

    def call(self, x):
        x = self.embedding(x)
        x *= tf.math.sqrt(tf.cast(self.d_model, tf.float32))
        x += self.positional_encoding[:, :tf.shape(x)[1], :]
        x = self.dropout(x)

        for i in range(self.num_layers):
            x = self.encoder_layers[i](x)

        x = self.final_layer(x[:, -1, :])  # Take the last token's representation
        return x

    def transformer_encoder_layer(self, d_model, num_heads):
        return tf.keras.Sequential([
            layers.MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=num_heads, key_dim=d_model // num_heads),
            layers.Dropout(0.1),
            layers.LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-6),
            layers.Dense(2048, activation='relu'),
            layers.Dropout(0.1),
            layers.LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-6)
        ])

    def positional_encoding(self, position, d_model):
        angle_rads = self.get_angles(np.arange(position)[:, np.newaxis], np.arange(d_model)[np.newaxis, :], d_model)
        angle_rads[:, 0::2] = np.sin(angle_rads[:, 0::2])
        angle_rads[:, 1::2] = np.cos(angle_rads[:, 1::2])

        pos_encoding = angle_rads[np.newaxis, ...]
        return tf.cast(pos_encoding, dtype=tf.float32)

    def get_angles(self, pos, i, d_model):
        angle_rates = 1 / np.power(10000, (2 * (i//2)) / np.float32(d_model))
        return pos * angle_rates

# Initialize and compile the Transformer model
num_heads = 8
d_model = 64
num_layers = 4
num_features = X_train_scaled.shape[1]

transformer_model = NFTTransformer(num_heads, d_model, num_layers, num_features)
transformer_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train the model
history_transformer = transformer_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

#The NFTTransformer class defines our custom Transformer model for NFT valuation. Let's break down its components:
#Embedding Layer: This layer converts the input features into a dense representation suitable for processing by the Transformer model.
#Positional Encoding: Since the Transformer model doesn't inherently understand the sequential order of inputs, we add positional encodings to provide positional information to the model.
#Transformer Encoder Layers: These layers consist of multi-head self-attention mechanisms followed by feed-forward neural networks and layer normalization. They enable the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence and learn complex relationships between features.
#Final Layer: This layer aggregates information from the last token's representation and produces the valuation prediction.
#Training: We compile the model with an optimizer (here, Adam) and specify the loss function (mean squared error) for training.
#Training the Model: We train the model on the training data for a certain number of epochs, monitoring its performance on a validation set.
#Now, let's evaluate the model's performance:

mse_transformer = transformer_model.evaluate(X_test_scaled, y_test)
print(f'Transformer Model MSE: {mse_transformer}')

# Calculate accuracy for Transformer Model
accuracy_transformer = (1 - mse_transformer / np.var(y_test)) * 100
print(f'Transformer Model Accuracy: {accuracy_transformer:.2f}%')

#This segment calculates the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and accuracy of the Transformer model on the test set. Adjustments may be needed based on the specific requirements of your task and dataset.
