#We'll develop a model inspired by recent advancements in deep learning and attention mechanisms called the Transformer architecture.
#The Transformer model, introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., has shown remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks. We'll adapt the Transformer architecture for our NFT valuation problem. This model will learn to attend to different features of the NFT metadata and sales data to predict the valuation.
#Here's the code implementing the Transformer model for NFT valuation:


import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, Model

# Define the Transformer model for NFT valuation
class NFTTransformer(Model):
    def __init__(self, num_heads, d_model, num_layers, num_features):
        super(NFTTransformer, self).__init__()
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.d_model = d_model
        self.num_layers = num_layers

        self.embedding = layers.Dense(d_model, activation='relu')
        self.positional_encoding = self.positional_encoding(num_features, self.d_model)

        self.encoder_layers = [self.transformer_encoder_layer(d_model, num_heads) for _ in range(num_layers)]
        self.dropout = layers.Dropout(0.1)
        self.final_layer = layers.Dense(1)

    def call(self, x):
        x = self.embedding(x)
        x *= tf.math.sqrt(tf.cast(self.d_model, tf.float32))
        x += self.positional_encoding[:, :tf.shape(x)[1], :]
        x = self.dropout(x)

        for i in range(self.num_layers):
            x = self.encoder_layers[i](x)

        x = self.final_layer(x[:, -1, :])  # Take the last token's representation
        return x

    def transformer_encoder_layer(self, d_model, num_heads):
        return tf.keras.Sequential([
            layers.MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=num_heads, key_dim=d_model // num_heads),
            layers.Dropout(0.1),
            layers.LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-6),
            layers.Dense(2048, activation='relu'),
            layers.Dropout(0.1),
            layers.LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-6)
        ])

    def positional_encoding(self, position, d_model):
        angle_rads = self.get_angles(np.arange(position)[:, np.newaxis], np.arange(d_model)[np.newaxis, :], d_model)
        angle_rads[:, 0::2] = np.sin(angle_rads[:, 0::2])
        angle_rads[:, 1::2] = np.cos(angle_rads[:, 1::2])

        pos_encoding = angle_rads[np.newaxis, ...]
        return tf.cast(pos_encoding, dtype=tf.float32)

    def get_angles(self, pos, i, d_model):
        angle_rates = 1 / np.power(10000, (2 * (i//2)) / np.float32(d_model))
        return pos * angle_rates

# Initialize and compile the Transformer model
num_heads = 8
d_model = 64
num_layers = 4
num_features = X_train_scaled.shape[1]

transformer_model = NFTTransformer(num_heads, d_model, num_layers, num_features)
transformer_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train the model
history_transformer = transformer_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

#The NFTTransformer class defines our custom Transformer model for NFT valuation. Let's break down its components:
#Embedding Layer: This layer converts the input features into a dense representation suitable for processing by the Transformer model.
#Positional Encoding: Since the Transformer model doesn't inherently understand the sequential order of inputs, we add positional encodings to provide positional information to the model.
#Transformer Encoder Layers: These layers consist of multi-head self-attention mechanisms followed by feed-forward neural networks and layer normalization. They enable the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence and learn complex relationships between features.
#Final Layer: This layer aggregates information from the last token's representation and produces the valuation prediction.
#Training: We compile the model with an optimizer (here, Adam) and specify the loss function (mean squared error) for training.
#Training the Model: We train the model on the training data for a certain number of epochs, monitoring its performance on a validation set.
#Now, let's evaluate the model's performance:

mse_transformer = transformer_model.evaluate(X_test_scaled, y_test)
print(f'Transformer Model MSE: {mse_transformer}')

# Calculate accuracy for Transformer Model
accuracy_transformer = (1 - mse_transformer / np.var(y_test)) * 100
print(f'Transformer Model Accuracy: {accuracy_transformer:.2f}%')

#To further expand on the application of the Transformer architecture for NFT valuation, we can delve into specific considerations and potential enhancements tailored to the characteristics of NFT data.
#Data Representation: NFT data typically contains categorical features, such as token type, skin tone, and other metadata. While the current implementation utilizes a dense embedding layer to convert these categorical features into continuous representations, we could explore alternative techniques such as learned embeddings or entity embeddings. These methods could better capture the relationships between different categories and potentially improve model performance.
#Temporal Dynamics: The current model architecture does not explicitly consider the temporal dynamics of NFT sales data. Incorporating temporal information, such as time-series embeddings or recurrent layers, could enable the model to capture patterns and trends in sales over time. This would be particularly relevant for predicting valuation changes over different time periods.
#Attention Mechanisms: Transformers are known for their attention mechanisms, which allow the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence. In the context of NFT valuation, attention could be applied not only to features within the metadata but also to temporal aspects such as the recency of sales and market trends. Custom attention mechanisms or modifications to existing attention layers could enhance the model's ability to extract relevant information from the data.
#Hybrid Models: Combining the strengths of different architectures could lead to more robust models. For example, we could explore hybrid models that combine Transformer layers with convolutional or recurrent layers to capture both local and global dependencies in the data. This approach could leverage the hierarchical structure of NFT metadata while also considering sequential patterns in sales data.
#Model Interpretability: Understanding how the model arrives at its predictions is crucial for interpretability and trust in the valuation process. Techniques such as attention visualization and feature importance analysis can provide insights into which features or time periods are most influential in determining the valuation of an NFT. Integrating these interpretability methods into the model training and evaluation process can help stakeholders understand the factors driving valuation predictions and identify areas for improvement.
#Handling Missing Data: NFT datasets may contain missing or incomplete information, which can impact model performance. Strategies such as data imputation or leveraging additional sources of information (e.g., external market data) to fill in missing values could improve the robustness of the model. Additionally, exploring techniques such as variational autoencoders or generative adversarial networks for data augmentation could help mitigate the effects of missing data by generating synthetic samples.
#Model Regularization: To prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance, incorporating regularization techniques such as dropout, batch normalization, or weight decay could be beneficial. Experimenting with different regularization schemes and tuning hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation can help optimize model performance while avoiding overfitting on the training data.
#Ensemble Methods: Ensemble learning techniques, such as bagging or boosting, can combine multiple models to improve prediction accuracy and robustness. Building an ensemble of Transformer models with different architectures or training on different subsets of the data could help capture diverse patterns and enhance the overall performance of the valuation system.
#By incorporating these considerations and potential enhancements, we can develop a more sophisticated and effective NFT valuation model using the Transformer architecture. Experimentation and iteration are key to refining the model and adapting it to the unique characteristics of the NFT market.
