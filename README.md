# NFT_valuations

The provided code demonstrates a comprehensive approach to building machine learning models for predicting the valuation of tokens in terms of Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency. Here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:

Data Preprocessing:
        The code effectively loads the data and preprocesses it by converting timestamps to datetime objects. However, there are some redundant steps, such as merging data on dates, which can be simplified.
        It might be beneficial to handle missing values in a more sophisticated manner. Currently, the code uses mean imputation, but exploring other methods like regression imputation or dropping rows with missing values could be considered.

Feature Engineering:
        The code performs one-hot encoding for categorical variables, which is appropriate. However, it's essential to ensure that the encoding is done correctly and efficiently, especially if the categorical variables have a large number of unique values.

Model Selection and Evaluation:
        The code trains and evaluates multiple models: Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, LSTM Neural Network and a Transformer Neural Network. This approach provides a good comparison of different algorithms.
        It's advisable to use cross-validation for more robust model evaluation, especially considering the relatively small dataset size.
        For the LSTM model, it would be helpful to visualize the training and validation loss over epochs, as done in the code, to assess model convergence and potential overfitting.

Hyperparameter Tuning:
        Hyperparameters for the models, especially for Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and LSTM, are not optimized in the provided code. Utilizing techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning could lead to better model performance.
        Including hyperparameter optimization for the LSTM network would

improve its performance significantly.

Visualization:
        The code includes visualization of the monthly average sale price, which provides insights into the data trends. Additionally, visualizing the model performance comparison and the training/validation loss of the LSTM model enhances the interpretability of the results.

Accuracy Calculation:
        The code calculates accuracy for regression models, which is not a typical metric for regression tasks. Instead, metrics like mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or R-squared should be used for evaluation.
        Consider using more appropriate evaluation metrics for regression tasks to provide a clearer understanding of model performance.

Code Efficiency and Structure:
        The code structure is clear and well-organized, making it easy to follow. However, some parts of the code could be modularized into functions for better readability and reusability.
        It's advisable to remove unnecessary imports and comments to streamline the code.

Documentation and Comments:
        While the code is well-commented in some parts, adding more comments to explain the rationale behind certain preprocessing steps, feature engineering techniques, and model choices would enhance its clarity and understanding.

Resource Utilization:
        Since the exercise suggests spending 4-6 hours on the problem, it's important to prioritize tasks and allocate time efficiently. Hyperparameter tuning and exploring additional model architectures might require more time, so it's crucial to balance time constraints with the complexity of the task.

In summary, while the provided code demonstrates a solid foundation for building machine learning models to predict token valuations, there are opportunities for improvement in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, evaluation, and code structure.
